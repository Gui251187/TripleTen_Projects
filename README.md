# TripleTen_Projects

I'm currecly working in a hotel, but in the meantime doing a bootcamp in Business Intelligence and Analytics and aspiring a career change into Data.

Iv'e background in Tech Sales with 5+ in startups and big companies.

Fun fact - I moved by my own to USA with U$ 2.700,00 in my pocket. As a huge dream that's transforming my journey everyday.
